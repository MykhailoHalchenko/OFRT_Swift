# SwiftUI Theme Toggle with Background App Optimization

This iOS app is built using SwiftUI and allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. The app also optimizes background processes by tracking screen timeout durations and allows for foreground/background process management to enhance performance in the background.

# Features:

1. Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark mode.
Dynamic Image Change: The background image changes based on the selected theme (sun/moon image).
2. Time Management: Users can set a timeout duration using either a slider or a text field.
Tracking Screen Timeout: The app monitors the screen timeout and blocks the screen after a specified duration.
3. Optimized for Background Processes: The app is designed to efficiently track background processes, such as monitoring the screen timeout, ensuring minimal performance impact on background tasks.

# How to Use:

1. Toggle Theme: Tap the sun/moon icon in the top left corner to switch between light and dark themes.
2. Set Timeout Duration: Use the slider or text field to set a timeout duration (from 30 to 1800 seconds).
3. Start/Stop Tracking: Tap the "Start" button to begin tracking the timeout and the "Stop" button to stop the tracking.
